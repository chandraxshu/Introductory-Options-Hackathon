**Spot price:** 646.06

**Market mid price (option):** 12.95

**Black-Scholes price (historical vol):** 14.1582

**Historical vol (annualized):** 37.41%


**Key interpretation:**

- Implied vol <= historical vol: option is not expensive relative to realized vol.


**Primary risks:**

- Delta exposure: 0.5306 per share (53.1 per contract)

- Vega (vol sensitivity): .355883 $ per 1 vol-point per share (35.5883 per contract)


**Basic hedge suggestion:**

- To neutralize delta for 1 long contract, trade -53.1 shares (short if negative).


**Monitoring suggestions:**

- Monitor implied vol vs realized vol and significant corporate events (earnings, guidance).

- Rebalance delta hedge daily (or as liquidity permits).


**Caveats:** Black-Scholes is a simplified model and ignores early exercise and discrete dividends.
